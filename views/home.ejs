                    <p>  

                        Hi guys!
                        
                        Glad to invite you to Codeforces Round #599 to be held this Wednesday, November 6, 2019 at 21:05UTC+6!
                        
                        My name is Evgeny Vihrov, this is already my 6th Codeforces contest as an author. To introduce myself, I have participated twice in the ACM ICPC Finals (2012, 2014) and currently I am co-coaching teams for the ICPC at the University of Latvia. This is my first solo round, and it took 3.5 years to make! (the last one was #347 with Alex_2oo8).
                        
                        In this contest you will have to help Ujan deal with his renovation issues. Hopefully, everyone will find a problem matching their taste!
                        
                        Huge thanks to arsijo for coordinating the preparation of the contest and for the patience with the frequent delays. :) Thanks to Xellos, Origenes, KAN and opukittpceno_hhr for generously testing the round. And as always, thanks to MikeMirzayanov for the panem et circenses Codeforces and Polygon systems!
                        
                        Wish you an exciting round!
                        
                        UPD1: McDic is joining as a coauthor of the contest (reasons to be revealed later)!
                        
                        UPD2: Scoring:

                        UPD5: The reason behind McDic entering as a coauthor is that one problem was exactly identical to some problem from some Codeforces round. We found out about it only at the last day before the contest, and McDic generously allowed to use his problem.

                            <almost-copy-pasted-part>
                            
                            Hello! Codeforces Round #598 (Div. 3) will start at Monday, November 4, 2019 at 19:15UTC+6. You will be offered 6 or 7 problems (or 8) with expected difficulties to compose an interesting competition for participants with ratings up to 1600. However, all of you who wish to take part and have rating 1600 or higher, can register for the round unofficially.
                            
                            The round will be hosted by rules of educational rounds (extended ACM-ICPC). Thus, during the round, solutions will be judged on preliminary tests, and after the round it will be a 12-hour phase of open hacks. I tried to make strong tests â€” just like you will be upset if many solutions fail after the contest is over.
                            
                            You will be given 6 or 7 (or 8) problems and 2 hours to solve them.
                            
                            Note that the penalty for the wrong submission in this round (and the following Div. 3 rounds) is 10 minutes.
                            
                            Remember that only the trusted participants of the third division will be included in the official standings table. As it is written by link, this is a compulsory measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as a trusted participants of the third division, you must:
                            
                                take part in at least two rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them),
                                do not have a point of 1900 or higher in the rating.
                            
                            Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the third division or not, if your rating is less than 1600, then the round will be rated for you.
                            
                            Thanks to MikeMirzayanov for the platform, help with ideas for problems and for coordination of my work. Thanks to my good friends Daria ZeroAmbition Stepanova, Mikhail PikMike Piklyaev, Maksim Ne0n25 Mescheryakov and Ivan BledDest Androsov for help in round preparation and testing the round.
                            
                            Good luck!
                            
                            I also would like to say that participants who will submit wrong solutions on purpose and hack them afterwards (example) will not be shown in the hacking leaders table.
